                <dt id="1">Where I was born</dt>
                <dd>I was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts on August 19, 1969 to my parents, Suzanne and John. </dd>
                <dt id="2">Known For</dt>
                <dd>I am most know for my role as Chandler Bing who I played for 10 years but you may also know me for my roles in, The Ron Clark Story, 17 Again or even The Whole Nine Yards. I have been wanting to become an actor my whole life so if you know me from any of those roles that means I made my dream happen.</dd>
                <dt id="3">How I became Chandler Bing</dt>
                <dd>I auditioned for it like I do many other projects but at the time the show was called, Six of One, but due to my previous commimitments to another show I almost didn't land the role. I eventually did get a call back for a table read and ended up getting the part of Chandler Bing and was also the youngest member on the cast which was sureal to me. </dd>
                <dt id="4">My book</dt>
                <dd>A hand is given to anybody dealing with sobriety in this remarkable book, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. It is both intimate and eye-opening. This is the book that fans have been waiting forâ€”unflinchingly honest, heartfelt, and hilarious. While writing it I just wanted to tell my life story and I think I did a pretty good job doing so. I became lucky enough to become New York Times Best Selling Author for writing a book about my life for the world to sit down and explore.</dd>
                <dt id="5">Why I can't watch Friends</dt>
                <dd>Whenever I watch Friends I cant help but get reminded of the terrible time I went through during filming becuase of the drugs I was taking. Everytime I watch the show I get reminded of what I put myself through and hate seeing the way I lived.</dd>
                <dt id="6">How I became famous</dt>
                <dd>I essentially became famous after a couple of seasons of Friends which led me to become a household name and due to the success of Friends I was casted in a numerous amount of projects after the fact that kept spreading my name.</dd>
                <dt id="7">Weight Lost</dt>
                <dd>I became addicted to Vicodin after a incident I got into in 1997 and dropped to 145 pounds after going to rehab. After that I lost another 20 pounds due to pancreatitis and then again went to rehab to battle drugs. Due to this battle with addiction I dont remember filming multiple seasons of Friends becuase I was so blinded by how many drugs I was on.</dd>
                <dt id="8">School</dt>
                <dd>I first attended school at Rockcliffe Park Public School and then went to Ashbury College in Ontario where I lived with my mother. When I turned 15 I decided to move to Los Angeles to persue my dream in acting and attended The Buckley School and after graduating I landed my first role in the TV series Second Chance which later became Boys Will Be Boys.</dd>
