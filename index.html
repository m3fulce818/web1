            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <img src="friends.png" alt="FRIENDS" width="300" height="200"> 
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>I was born on August 19, 1969 in Williamstown, Massachusetts to my parents, Suzanne, who was a journalist, and my father John, who was an American actor. My parents split up just before my first birthday and I was raised by my mother with her new husband who was a journalist. I went to school in Ontario and became a top-ranked tennis player but later moved to Los Angeles at the age of 15.</p>
            <p>I moved to California to live with my father and persue my dream of acting and graduating from The Buckley School in 1987. After I graduated I had been able to land my first role in the TV show, <cite>Boys Will Be Boys</cite>, from the success of the show I was able to land my first on screen role in, <cite>A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon</cite>. </p>

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>After my first on screen role and went and landed a few small roles before stumbling upon a role that would change my life. At first it was called, <cite>Six of One</cite>, which was eventually called, <cite>FRIENDS</cite>, and now initially I almost didn't get the role but eventually I landed the role of Chandler Bing. The show became highly successful and changed my life for good, it was something that I always wished for.</p>
            <p>While I did go through addiction in the midst of filming and not remembering filming half the season, acting on the show gave me the fame I had always been longing for. I landed roles in a numerous amount of films and TV shows, getting award nominations for <cite>Friends, The West Wing, The Ron Clark Story</cite>, and more. If I hadn't moved to California with my dad to persue acting im not sure where I'd be today.</p>

            <h3>Success and Struggles</h3>
            <p>After getting roles that would change my life forever and make me 1 million dollars an episode, I went on to write my own book called, <cite>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing</cite>. Today it is said that my networth is around 80 million and I am thankful for my first ever acting role because without it I wouldnt have a dollar to my name, I'd probably still be trying to get a grip on acting.</p>
            <p>Although I may have been living the life, I still went through a rough time following a accident I had in 1997. I fell into addiction to multiple drugs and alcohol. I lost tons of weight and from seasons 3 to 6 of friends I don't even remember filming. I spent millions trying to better myself and entered a rehab center in 2015 and thankfully I have been sober since May of 2021.</p>
